# REX AI — v0.1

A mobile-first AI assistant web app that can also be installed on Android as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Features
- Responsive dark interface
- AI chat through a server-side API route
- Hindi speech input in supported browsers
- PWA manifest and service worker for installability
- API key stays on the server, never in browser JavaScript

## Run / deploy
1. Import this repository into Vercel.
2. In Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables, add `GROQ_API_KEY`.
3. Optional: add `GROQ_MODEL` to choose a model supported by your Groq account.
4. Deploy. Open the deployment URL in Chrome on Android and use the browser's Install app option.

The app interface can load without a key, but live AI replies require the server-side key. Do not commit API keys or passwords to GitHub.

## Android
This first version is an installable PWA. It can be added to the Android home screen. A native APK wrapper can be added as a later milestone after the web app is tested.
